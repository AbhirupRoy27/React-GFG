## Notes

- React’s Strict Mode double rendering in development. So, When you switch away and come back, React (and the browser) can sometimes trigger a re-render
- React re-rendering when the component’s parent re-renders.
- useRef updates are invisible to React’s rendering cycle. The UI only updates when some other reason forces a render
